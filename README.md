# Master Chef's Kiss

This is a site created with the idea of being able to find recipes for those days where you lack inspiration. A space for people to share their creations and leave feedback of their own experiences. Cooking can be hard. Why not make it just that little bit easier.

Using our site you will be able to browse, search, add, and delete recipes that have been compiled for your use. We have 7 primary screens. Home, Sign In, Sign Up, Browse, Search, Details, Add, and Edit.
